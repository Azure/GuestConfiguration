SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The Guest Configuration PowerShell module provides commands that automate publishing custom
    content for Azure Policy to audit settings inside Azure virtual machines and Arc connected machines.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    There are a few tasks that this module automates:

    - Create the content package (.zip) from an existing DSC configuration (.mof)
    - Functional validation of the content package
        - Contains required files
        - Runs the Audit against the local machine using the agent binaries used in Azure
    - Publish the package to Azure blob storage
    - Create the JSON files for the Azure Policy definitions (auditifnotexists, deployifnotexists, initiative)
    - Publish the Azure Policy definitions to the currently selected subscription

EXAMPLES
    PS C:\> New-GuestConfigurationPackage -Path . -Configuration MyPolicy.mof -Name MyPolicy -Force
